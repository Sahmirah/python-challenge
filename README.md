# Python Challenge
This challenge focuses on two Python Challenges, PyBank and PyPoll. Both tasks focused on real-world situations where I was able to utilize my newfound Python skills. 

## PyBank Instructions: 
In this Challenge, I was tasked with creating a Python script to analyze a financial dataset called budget_data.csv. The dataset is composed of two columns: "Date" and "Profit/Losses".

I created a Python script that analyzed the records to calculate each of the following values:

1. The total number of months included in the dataset

2. The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

3. The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes

4. The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

5. The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

## PyPoll Instructions: 
In this Challenge, I was tasked with helping a small, rural town modernize its vote-counting process.

I utilized a dataset consisting of poll data called election_data.csv. The dataset is composed of three columns: "Voter ID", "County", and "Candidate". I created a Python script that analyzed the votes and calculated each of the following values:

1. The total number of votes cast

2. A complete list of candidates who received votes

3. The percentage of votes each candidate won

4. The total number of votes each candidate won

5. The winner of the election based on the popular vote

### Technologies/Languages Used: 
1. Python
2. VS Code
3. Excel
